refresh - a macports manager

#[Deprecated]

This program runs a macports selfupdate and upgrade outdated and uninstall inactive. 
It captures its output in logs using the tee and log files managed by logrotate
it reports its stages to the screen using applescript. 

it uses untested code to perform xcode integration

It needs to run as root.

an install would be good, as would an applescript rewrite
a display commands would be good, a verbose error would be good

* v1.3 functions and uninstall inactive & clean
* v1.2 implements logrotate
